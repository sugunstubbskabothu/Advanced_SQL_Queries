# Advanced_SQL_Queries
Here are Some of the Advanced_SQl Queries . These Queries are wrriten in #MYSQLWORKBENCH . In this i have created a sql database called "SUPERSTORES" from the XLS files or Excel files . In these Queries i have used JOINTS and also written Nested Queries . Joints combines columns from one or more tables in a relational database. It creates a set that can be saved as a table or used as it is .

I have also mentioned about identifying #PRIMARY and #FOREIGN KEYS in a database . PRIMARY KEY is the column which is having unique records and doesnâ€™t contain any null values.There can be only one primary key in a table. FOREIGN KEYS is the columns which can have repeated records which would be joined with the primary key of other table . Foreign keys may contain null values . There can be many foreign keys in a tables .
